# TODO: Create node that performs stereo block matching to compute disparity map
# from stereo pair images. Need this for euroc dataset, for example--as no depth
# map is provided. While this will be a tad different from what the realsense
# spits out / computes onboard, need this for evaluation.

# I think it would be best to base this off of stephen ferro's SGM code. Could
# also potentially get away with just using the stereo image proc nodes from
# ROS. Not sure yet.
